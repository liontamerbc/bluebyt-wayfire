## üñ•Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Arch Linux installed (minimal or with your preferred desktop environment).

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

**Recommended: Automated Installer**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/liontamerbc/bluebyt-wayfire.git
cd bluebyt-wayfire
./installer.sh
```

### GNOME Desktop Option

You can install GNOME as a fallback desktop by passing the `-g` or `--gnome` option:

```sh
./installer.sh -g        # or
./installer.sh --gnome
```

This is **highly recommended for new setups** or if you want a reliable troubleshooting environment.

---

## üìù Manual Installation

Although the installer automates most hardware detection and driver installation, here is a summary of what it does for reference:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Including build tools, libraries, and core packages for Wayfire and all included utilities.

### 2. Build and Install Wayfire, wf-shell, wcm, and Pixdecor

Clones and builds from source:
- [Wayfire](https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire)
- [wf-shell](https://github.com/WayfireWM/wf-shell)
- [wcm](https://github.com/WayfireWM/wcm)
- [Pixdecor](https://github.com/soreau/pixdecor)

### 3. Install GPU, CPU, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth Drivers

- Detects Intel/AMD CPUs and installs microcode.
- Detects NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel GPUs and installs the appropriate drivers.
- Detects common Broadcom/Realtek Wi-Fi chipsets and guides AUR driver installation if needed.
- Installs `networkmanager`, `wireless_tools`, and `linux-firmware`.
- Installs `bluez` and `bluez-utils`, and enables Bluetooth.

### 4. Theme, Icons, and Configurations

- Installs your chosen GTK theme and icon set.
- Applies theme and icons via config.
- Copies all config files, scripts, and dotfiles to your home directory.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

- Configs are stored in `$HOME/.config/wayfire.ini` and `$HOME/.config/wf-shell.ini`.
- The installer will back up your existing configs.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Log out of your current session.
2. At your login manager (e.g., GDM), select the "Wayfire" session.
3. Log in and enjoy your new desktop environment!

## üí° Why install GNOME as a fallback?

Wayfire is a powerful compositor, but a minimal system may leave you without a graphical fallback if something goes wrong.  
**The installer allows you to automatically install GNOME (`-g` or `--gnome`) as a stable, full-featured desktop for troubleshooting and recovery.**

**Benefits:**
- Reliable fallback: Always be able to log into a working desktop if Wayfire fails.
- Graphical tools for system/network/bluetooth/display.
- Improved hardware support (drivers, firmware).
- Safe for experimentation: you can always return to GNOME if you break your Wayfire config.

---

## üé® Advanced: Follow Focus & Inactive Alpha

These features are now fully automated by the installer:

- Sets up the required environment variable.
- Downloads and configures `inactive-alpha.py` and `wayfire_socket.py`.
- Updates your `wayfire.ini` with the correct plugins and autostart entries.
- Makes all scripts executable.

No manual action required.
