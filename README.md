## Why Install GNOME First?

Installing GNOME before Wayfire is **strongly recommended** for most users, especially on a fresh Arch Linux setup, for several reasons:

1. **Reliable Fallback:** GNOME provides a stable desktop for troubleshooting if Wayfire fails to start or you encounter hardware/configuration issues.
2. **Easier Troubleshooting:** GNOME includes graphical tools for managing network, bluetooth, drivers, display settings, etc.
3. **Automatic Hardware Support:** GNOME brings in a wide array of drivers, firmware, and utilities for better hardware compatibility.
4. **Smooth User Experience:** GNOME sets up user accounts, permissions, and session management, reducing headaches.
5. **Safe Experimentation:** With GNOME as a backup, you can freely experiment with Wayfire knowing you can always log into a working desktop.

## Requirements

- Arch Linux or derivative (Manjaro, EndeavourOS, etc.)
- Internet connection
- `sudo` privileges
- ~2GB available disk space

---

## Notes

- **Aretha-Dark-Icons:** Download `Aretha-Dark-Icons.tar.gz` from [gnome-look.org](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/2180417) and place it in the same directory as the script before running.
- **Wallpaper:** Place wallpapers in a `Wallpaper` subdirectory next to the script, if desired.
- **Custom dotfiles:** Place your `.config` and `.bin` in the script directory for copying, or edit the script for alternate sources.

## FAQ

**Q: Does this set screen resolution automatically?**  
A: No, Wayfire will auto-detect most displays, but you may need to use `wcm` (Wayfire Config Manager) to set resolution and scaling.

**Q: Do I need to install GNOME?**  
A: Not required, but highly recommended for troubleshooting and fallback, especially on fresh installs.

**Q: What does dry-run do?**  
A: It prints all actions the script would take, but makes no changes‚Äîgreat for previewing.

**Q: Is this script idempotent?**  
A: It backs up existing configs and removes build directories as needed, but always review and understand changes for your system.

## Troubleshooting

- If you experience issues, review the log file (e.g., `install_wayfire_2025-06-05_15:23:30.log`).
- For driver/firmware issues, refer to the script‚Äôs output and Arch Wiki.
- If you end up with a black screen after login, use GNOME or a TTY to fix configs.
